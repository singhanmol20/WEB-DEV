        <p id="description">
            <br><br>
            Seven to eight years back, CSS developers brought a fifth child into the positioning element world. The name
            of this element was “sticky” because all it does is get ‘stick’ to the viewport and just be in your sight
            (depending on the developer though). Although the sticky property of an element gives a name to a particular
            property in CSS, it does not bring anything ‘new” to the table. If I say, “let’s use a sticky div box,” you
            know what I am talking about, but before its release people would just define what they wanted to do like
            “Can I have a div box that would always be visible or available even if the people are scrolling?”

            The entire point of bringing this up is to tell you that stickiness existed in web development long before
            it was introduced as a standard in CSS. This post will dive into the CSS position sticky, and we will find
            out how to get the CSS position fixed. Before we do that, let’s briefly see how people used the position
            sticky property before its official release.

                Need For Position Sticky In CSS
                As I mentioned, the position sticky in CSS was used even before it came out as a standard in CSS. So,
                why did they introduce it when everything was working fine?

                Apart from CSS, the stickiness can be achieved through JavaScript also. In JavaScript, we make the use
                of scroll event handlers and calculate the offset of the page. With these values, we make calculations
                to stick the element as soon as the offset reaches a point. This used to work earlier, but for the last
                eight-nine years, scroll handlers became a total mess when better graphics were introduced in the
                systems.

                The problem with scroll handlers is that unlike CSS, it relies on the CPU for doing its job. On the
                other hand, CSS uses hardware acceleration (a standard on all the browsers now for better cross browser
                compatibility), which means it relies on the GPU for doing its job. Due to this, we would often see the
                UI of the website, breaking down quickly when the sticky element is coded in JavaScript. A better
                solution to this is bringing the stickiness to the GPU. The only way to do that is by introducing it as
                a standard in CSS. Looking back, it actually makes a lot of sense. So, the “sticky” property was added
                to the positions which already had four values. To understand how to get “CSS position fixed,” we should
                know the behavior of other CSS values.

                A position sticky element toggles between the relative value and the fixed value on the viewport. The
                state on which the CSS sticky element is currently present depends on the scroll position of the browser
                window.

                The position of the CSS sticky element depends upon the given offset or a threshold top, bottom, left,
                and right value that the developer provides. If the element has not yet reached the threshold, it
                retains in the relative position. Once the threshold is reached, you’ve got the CSS position fixed and
                the elements get “stuck” to the same block. This is not a one-time operation though. The CSS position
                sticky element toggles between these two positions depending on the scroll of the page. So, a CSS
                position sticky element that is currently “fixed” will move back to the “relative” when it will meet the
                opposite end of its container block.
                You need to create position sticky elements to achieve what they call ‘CSS position fixed’. As I have
                shown you above, a CSS position sticky is always in the website visitor’s viewport. Creating a position
                sticky element in CSS as I did above is very easy. But you will have to keep two things in mind:

                Declaring the position value as sticky for the element.
                Defining a relative value (also called the threshold value).
                sticky header can be used to stick the heading of a paragraph to the browser window. So, if the
                paragraph changes and so does it’s heading, a new heading sticks to the browser until the user scrolls
                the complete paragraph. The following code has been used to create a sticky header:
            </p>
